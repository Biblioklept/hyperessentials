<summary>Additional work you may want to do:</summary>
<br>

- **Run the installers.** The Unofficial Fallout 3 ESM Patcher and the Fallout Anniversary Patcher requires administrator permissions, so you'll need to open the mod folder and go to build to run the installer, as it isnt recommended to run MO2 in administrator unless absolutely necessary. *For the Fallout Anniversary Patcher, you will need to move your Fallout3.exe file into the Root folder and run the Patcher.exe file.* *For the Unofficial Fallout 3 ESM Patcher, run the Unofficial Fallout 3 ESM Patcher.exe in the Build folder, and select the mod folder in your MO2 installation to install the fixed ESMs.*
