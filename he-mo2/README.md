### [Latest Version](https://github.com/Biblioklept/hyperessentials/releases/tag/HEMO2.1.0.0)

The absolute essentials to run... Mod Organizer 2?

A Wabbajack file that downloads Mod Organizer 2 and RootBuilder. Should be good for most modlists built around Bethesda games.

__Important Notes:__

- This modlist requires SSE, it was made with that as it is by far the most popular and frequently modded game on Wabbajack.
- It will popup with an error when you launch ModOrganizer2.exe, ignore it, this is to allow you to choose which game you want to mod.
