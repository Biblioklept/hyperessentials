How to install TTW into HEFNV.

- Make a new profile, HETTW was the old profile name, you're free to choose whatever name you like though.
- Select the HETTW profile.
- Follow this guide's MO2 and TTW sections.
- Install TTW in your Game Files section. Add a `[NoDelete]` before your TTW files so when an update comes out you don't lose your TTW files.
- Unselect `Yukichigai Unofficial Patch - YUP`.
- Unselect `Unofficial Patch NVSE Plus`.
- Unselect `New Vegas Mesh Improvement Mod - NVMIM`.
- Unselect `ExRB - Extended Roombounds`.
- Unselect `New Vegas Quick Start`.
- OPTIONAL: Install [Tale of Two Wastelands Quick Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65937) into your Quick Start section. Add a `[NoDelete]` before this mod so when an update comes out you don't lose your files.
- It is recommended to delete your `ModOrganizer.ini` to make sure you don't use LOOT and have the proper TTW load order.
