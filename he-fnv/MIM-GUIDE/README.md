How to install mesh fixes into HEFNV (if you don't know how to, somehow.)

- Download [Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65052)
- Download [New Vegas Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74295)
- If you downloaded both, feel free to download the [MIM-MERGE file](./dl/MIM-MERGE.7z), to save yourself a slot.
- Install all downloaded mods to the `Bug Fixes` section.
- If you installed the `MIM-MERGE` file, double click on the `Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod`, go to `Optional ESPs`, and move it from the `Available ESPs` section, to the `Optional ESPs` section. Do the same for the `New Vegas Mesh Improvement Mod` if installed.
- Sort your modlist, manually is recommended to counter LOOT's errors, however if you feel like using LOOT, I can't stop you.
