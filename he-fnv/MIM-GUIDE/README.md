How to install mesh fixes into HEFNV (if you don't know how to, somehow.)

- Download [Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65052)
- Install it under NVMIM in your Bug Fixes section
- Feel free to download the [MIM-MERGE file](./dl/MIM-MERGE.7z), to save yourself an ESP slot.
- Install all downloaded mods to the `Bug Fixes` section.
- If you installed the `MIM-MERGE` file, double click on the `New Vegas Mesh Improvement Mod`, go to `Optional ESPs`, and move it from the `Available ESPs` section, to the `Optional ESPs` section. Do the same for the `Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod` if installed.
- Sort your modlist: Put WMIM's esp under NVMIM. If using MIM-Merge, put its ESP file where NVMIM was.

**NOTE:** You do not need to have Vanilla Iron Sights - Redux installed if you have this installed, however, It doesn't hurt to keep it enabled.
