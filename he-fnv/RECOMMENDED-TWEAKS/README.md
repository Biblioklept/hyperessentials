# Recommended Tweaks for HE-FNV

It's recommended that you rename your `Quick Start` section to `Tweaks`. These tweaks aim to improve what you're given in the base game with minimal ESP files, they also aim to have as minimal gameplay changes as possible.

**Start off by looking through Stewie Tweaks, then use these as you see fit.**

### Gameplay

- [No More DLC Messages](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75686)
> Disables DLC messages at start, as well as the Courier's Stash DLC messages. I recommend you look at the config file if you want to disable certain pre-order packs.
- [Hardcore Forever](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75682) - (recommended if you like Hardcore)
> Enables Hardcore mode and disables the selection message.
- [Wild Wasteland Forever](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71609)
> Has some fixes for Wild Wasteland, allows you to get YCS-186 and the Alien Blaster, along other tweaks.
- [Four Eyes Get Eyeglasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69565)
> Players choosing the Four Eyes perk will get eyeglasses at the beginning of the game.
- [Auto Activate Invisible Doors](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80650)
> Automatically activates invisible doors when near them.

> Removes any kind of blur from the game.
- [No More Explosions Blindness](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73572)
