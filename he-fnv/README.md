### [Latest Version](https://github.com/Biblioklept/hyperessentials/releases/tag/HEFNV.2.1.0)

The absolute essentials to run New Vegas and any mods that may have the usual requirements. Comes with quickstart.

<details>
<summary>Additional work you may want to do:</summary>
<br>

- **Run the Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes installer.** The Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes installer requires administrator permissions, so you'll need to open the mod folder and go to build to run the installer, as it isnt recommended to run MO2 in administrator unless absolutely necessary.
- **Fix your weapon meshes.** Weapon mesh fixes are not included by default, as they're aren't a hard requirement to get your game running bug-free, however, many do still like using them. So a guide is provided [here](./MIM-GUIDE).
- **Tweak the game a little more.** Some things of the vanilla game still bothered me, but aren't strictly bug fixes, this is where the [recommended tweaks](./RECOMMENDED-TWEAKS) come in. Ideally removes some annoyances that I found in the base game.

<details>
<summary>Some notes:</summary>
<br>

- I would recommend using a different name beyond HE-FNV/HEFNV. This will be your modlist in the end after all.
- The `User - INIs` file that is provided is so that you can easily reinstall and revert your INI files. It's also to prevent changes to the base INI files. IF you do not plan to change the files, you are free to disable it.

<summary>Additional resources:</summary>
<br>

- [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) - you can skip everything the base section, as it's all covered in this list.
- [Wall_SoGB's Performance and Stability Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com) - Stewie Tweaks and NVTF changes are included, however the rest couldn't be provided, as they're system tweaks and highly dependent on your system.
- [Salamand3r's Texture Guide](https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide) - a very good resource for overhauling New Vegas and TTW visually.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting:</summary>
<br>

~~Problem: Installers won't run when I run them from MO2.~~
~~- Run them by going to the build folder using Windows Explorer. They require administrator permissions.~~
