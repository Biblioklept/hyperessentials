The absolute essentials to run New Vegas (and TTW) and any mods that may have the usual requirements. Comes with quickstarts.

<details>
<summary>Additional work you may want to do:</summary>
<br>

- **Run the installers.** Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes and the TTW installers both require administrator permissions, so you'll need to open the mod folder and go to build to run either installer, as it isnt recommended to run MO2 in administrator unless absolutely necessary.

<summary>Additional resources:</summary>
<br>

- [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) - you can skip the through everything before the bug fixes section, as it's all covered in this list.
- [Wasteland Survival Guide](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com) - essentially the same as above, except for TTW.
- [Wall_SoGB's Performance and Stability Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com) - Stewie Tweaks and NVTF changes are included, however the rest couldn't be provided, as they're system tweaks and highly dependent on your system.
- [Salamand3r's Texture Guide](https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide) - a very good resource for overhauling New Vegas and TTW visually.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting:</summary>
<br>

Problem: Installers won't run when I run them from MO2.
- Run them by going to the build folder using Windows Explorer. They require administrator permissions.
