### [Latest Version](https://github.com/Biblioklept/hyperessentials/releases/tag/HEFNV.1.2.0)

The absolute essentials to run New Vegas and any mods that may have the usual requirements. Comes with quickstart.

<details>
<summary>Additional work you may want to do:</summary>
<br>

- **Run the installers.** The Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes installer requires administrator permissions, so you'll need to open the mod folder and go to build to run the installer, as it isnt recommended to run MO2 in administrator unless absolutely necessary.
- **Fix your weapon meshes.** Weapon mesh fixes are not included by default, as they're aren't a hard requirement to get your game running bug-free, however, many do still like using them. So a guide is provided [here](./MIM-GUIDE).

<summary>Additional resources:</summary>
<br>

- [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) - you can skip everything through the bug fixes section, as it's all covered in this list.
- [Wall_SoGB's Performance and Stability Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com) - Stewie Tweaks and NVTF changes are included, however the rest couldn't be provided, as they're system tweaks and highly dependent on your system.
- [Salamand3r's Texture Guide](https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide) - a very good resource for overhauling New Vegas and TTW visually.

<summary>Troubleshooting:</summary>
<br>

~~Problem: Installers won't run when I run them from MO2.~~
~~- Run them by going to the build folder using Windows Explorer. They require administrator permissions.~~
