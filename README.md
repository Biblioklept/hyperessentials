What you need to run the game and any mods that may have the usual requirements. Intended to be used as a base or as the absolute necessities to get the game running with some extras (usually quickstarts and additional script extender resources). 

Games that provide functional Steam Workshop collection support will likely use the Steam Workshop as an alternative to having an external Mod Manager. (For example, [Kenshi](./he-ks).)

Some games don't have a preferable way to manage mods, like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy (do not recommend JSGME, it's not good enough for me personally, however you are free to use it.), in which case I will simply find some other way to install mods automatically, like a batch script, which is provided for [Shadow of Chernobyl](./he-shoc). You are free to look at the source if you want, it's as simple as editing the file.

I try to automate these as much as possible, however, games like [Daggerfall (Unity)](./he-tes2) will require a manual guide, as Wabbajack does not support it and I have yet to find an installer that does what I need it to do. If Wabbajack provides Daggerfall Unity support, I will provide an alternative to the manual guide.

Updates are more frequent the more I play the game and if they are needed. For instance I will update Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Tale of Two Wastelands more than I would The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, due to both cases of how much I play the game and how little mods get updated that are required to run the game.
