# Recommended Tweaks for HE-TTW

It's recommended that you rename your `Quick Start` section to `Tweaks`. These tweaks aim to improve what you're given in the base game with minimal ESP files, they also aim to have as minimal gameplay changes as possible.

**Start off by looking through Stewie Tweaks, then use these as you see fit.**

### TTW-Focused Overhauls

- [TTW - Anchorage Skip](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77871)
> Allows you to skip the Operation: Anchorage DLC with a high enough science level. Look through the config file to tweak it as you like.
- [TTW - Bypass Tranquility Lane](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81182)
> Allows you to skip the Tranquility Lane quest with a high enough science level.
- [(Benny Humbles You) and Steals Your Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71112)
> Benny takes all the player's gear when they enter the Mojave, locks it in a safe in the Tops Presidential Suite, and gives Benny the key. Look through the config file to tweak it as you like.
- [TTW Reputations](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68604)
> Adds a functional reputation system to Fallout 3 alike New Vegas.
- [TTW New Vegas Speech Checks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68736)
> Converts all Fallout 3 dialogue to use the New Vegas speech system. Get the patch for TTW Reputations if you have it.

### Gameplay

- [No More DLC Messages](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75686)
> Disables DLC messages at start, as well as the Courier's Stash DLC messages. I recommend you look at the config file if you want to disable certain pre-order packs.
- [Hardcore Forever](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75682) - (recommended if you like Hardcore)
> Enables Hardcore mode and disables the selection message.
- [Wild Wasteland Forever](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71609)
> Has some fixes for Wild Wasteland, allows you to get YCS-186 and the Alien Blaster, along other tweaks.
- [Four Eyes Get Eyeglasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69565)
> Players choosing the Four Eyes perk will get eyeglasses at the beginning of the game. Get the TTW version.
- [Auto Activate Invisible Doors](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80650)
> Automatically activates invisible doors when near them.

### Visuals

> Removes any kind of blur from the game.
- [No More Explosions Blindness](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73572)
