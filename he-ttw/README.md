- [Wasteland Survival Guide](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com) - great modding guide if you want to get more out of TTW.
- [Wall_SoGB's Performance and Stability Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com) - Stewie Tweaks and NVTF changes are included, however the rest couldn't be provided, as they're system tweaks and highly dependent on your system.
- [Salamand3r's Texture Guide](https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide) - a very good resource for overhauling New Vegas and TTW visually.
