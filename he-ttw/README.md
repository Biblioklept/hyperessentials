<summary>Additional work you may want to do:</summary>
<br>

- **Tweak the game a little more.** Some things of the vanilla game still bothered me, but aren't strictly bug fixes, this is where the [recommended tweaks](./RECOMMENDED-TWEAKS) come in. Ideally removes some annoyances that I found in the base game.

<summary>Some notes:</summary>
<br>

- I would recommend using a different name beyond HE-FNV/HEFNV. This will be your modlist in the end after all.
- The `User - INIs` file that is provided is so that you can easily reinstall and revert your INI files. It's also to prevent changes to the base INI files. IF you do not plan to change the files, you are free to disable it.

- [Wasteland Survival Guide](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com) - great modding guide if you want to get more out of TTW.
- [Wall_SoGB's Performance and Stability Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com) - Stewie Tweaks and NVTF changes are included, however the rest couldn't be provided, as they're system tweaks and highly dependent on your system.
- [Salamand3r's Texture Guide](https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide) - a very good resource for overhauling New Vegas and TTW visually.
