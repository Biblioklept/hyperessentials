The absolute essentials to run Kenshi bug-free. 

There is an [expansion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2970367151) for those who want a little bit more of what I consider "fixes". However, it does not mix well with the original list's vision, so they have been excluded and put in this list.

This list includes [Unofficial Patches for Kenshi](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2714086775), which may be incompatible with some mods. To check for compatibility, please look at their [compatibility discussion page](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2714086775/3193618786002617705/).

It is recommended that you look at this [load order guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1850250979), as it provides the load order you should use when sorting your mods. The mods listed here should be completely compatible with each other, however if you decide to add the expansion and/or your own mods (which you most likely will do) you will need to sort your load order as detailed.
