The absolute essentials to run Skyrim: SE/AE and any mods that may have the usual requirements. Comes with quickstart.

This list supports 1.5, 1.6, GOG, and VR. There will be a lot of downloads because of this, if it proves too much of an issue I will remove VR and 1.5 support as VR is a niche and 1.5 is slowly (if not already) obsolete.
