## Setup - Part 1

To get the best start with this modlist, it's recommended that you: A. Get a fresh install of vanilla Daggerfall; B. Get a fresh install of Daggerfall UNITY.

### Installing _vanilla_ Daggerfall:

Grab the latest files from one of these three sources:
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/)
- [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_chapter_ii_daggerfall) - **NOT THE GOG CUT**
- [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Files)

Install it like you usually would, keep note of where the files are stored.
> Example: `C:/Games/The Elder Scrolls Daggerfall`

### Installing Daggerfall UNITY:

- Grab the latest files from the [latest release](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/releases/latest)
- Go to your install folder
- Make a new folder, name it something memorable.
> Example: `DFU`
- Run it once.
- Point the files to your _vanilla_ Daggerfall files.
> The files should be in `The Elder Scrolls Daggerfall\DF\DAGGER`
- Configure the game as you wish in the main and advanced options menu.
> Recommended settings to enable: Smaller dungeons, Bows - Draw and release, Toggle Sneak.

### Setting up Mod Organizer 2

- Grab the latest files from the [latest release](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/latest)
> Be sure to download the .7z file.
- Extract it to somewhere memorable.
> Example: `C:/Modlists/HETES2`
- Open **ModOrganizer2.exe**

In the Mod Organizer 2 Installation:
- Create a portable instance
- Browse...
- _Find your Daggerfall **UNITY** installation_
- If/when prompted for: `Show tutorial?` Select `No`.
- If/when prompted for: `Register?` Select `Yes`.

Optional steps:
- Go to the Settings menu.
- Change the theme to whatever you want.
> I recommend `1809 Dark Mode`.
- Make a new profile.
- Name it whatever you want. 
> Example: HETES2.
- Select the new profile.
