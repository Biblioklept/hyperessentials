## Tips - Part 5

- When installing mods, it's wise to double check the folder afterwords to be sure it's installed correctly.
- If a mod does not work, it's likely outdated, if you're lucky there might be a fork of it on the DFU Workshop forums.
- Always check for patches if you install a mod that will likely need them. These are usually mods that do more than just one small edit.
- Quests will eventually break in Daggerfall, with **very old** procedural generation, that's bound to happen. It's not the end of the world.
